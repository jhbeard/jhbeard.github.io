Documentation\nsource files are written in Markdown, and configured with a single YAML\nconfiguration file.\n\n\nHost anywhere\n\uf0c1\n\n\nMkDocs builds completely static HTML sites that you can host on GitHub pages,\nAmazon S3, or \nanywhere\n else you choose.\n\n\nGreat themes available\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThere's a stack of good looking themes available for MkDocs. Choose between\nthe built in themes: \nmkdocs\n and \nreadthedocs\n, select one of the 3rd\nparty themes in the \nMkDocs wiki\n, or \nbuild your own\n.\n\n\nPreview your site as you work\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe built-in dev-server allows you to preview your documentation as you're\nwriting it. It will even auto-reload and refresh your browser whenever you save\nyour changes.\n\n\nEasy to customize\n\uf0c1\n\n\nGet your project documentation looking just the way you want it by customizing\nthe theme.\n\n\n\n\nInstallation\n\uf0c1\n\n\nInstall with a Package Manager\n\uf0c1\n\n\nIf you have and use a package manager (such as \napt-get\n, \ndnf\n, \nhomebrew\n,\n\nyum\n, \nchocolatey\n, etc.) to install packages on your system, then you may\nwant to search for a \"MkDocs\" package and, if a recent version is available,\ninstall it with your package manager (check your system's documentation for\ndetails). That's it, you're done! Skip down to \nGetting Started\n.\n\n\nIf your package manager does not have a recent \"MkDocs\" package, you can still\nuse your package manager to install \"Python\" and \"pip\". Then you can use pip to\n\ninstall MkDocs\n.\n\n\nManual Installation\n\uf0c1\n\n\nIn order to manually install MkDocs you'll need \nPython\n installed on your\nsystem, as well as the Python package manager, \npip\n. You can check if you have\nthese already installed from the command line:\n\n\n$ python --version\nPython 2.7.2\n$ pip --version\npip 1.5.2\n\n\n\n\nMkDocs supports Python versions 2.6, 2.7, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5 and pypy.\n\n\nInstalling Python\n\uf0c1\n\n\nInstall \nPython\n by downloading an installer appropriate for your system from\n\npython.org\n and running it.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf you are installing Python on Windows, be sure to check the box to have\nPython added to your PATH if the installer offers such an option (it's\nnormally off by default).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstalling pip\n\uf0c1\n\n\nIf you're using a recent version of Python, the Python package manager, \npip\n,\nis most likely installed by default. However, you may need to upgrade pip to the\nlasted version:\n\n\npip install --upgrade pip\n\n\n\n\nIf you need to install \npip\n for the first time, download \nget-pip.py\n.\nThen run the following command to install it:\n\n\npython get-pip.py\n\n\n\n\nInstalling MkDocs\n\uf0c1\n\n\nInstall the \nmkdocs\n package using pip:\n\n\npip install mkdocs\n\n\n\n\nYou should now have the \nmkdocs\n command installed on your system. Run \nmkdocs\n--version\n to check that everything worked okay.\n\n\n$ mkdocs --version\nmkdocs, version 0.15.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf you are using Windows, some of the above commands may not work\nout-of-the-box.\n\n\nA quick solution may be to preface every Python command with \npython -m\n\nlike this:\n\n\npython -m pip install mkdocs\npython -m mkdocs\n\n\n\nFor a more permanent solution, you may need to edit your \nPATH\n environment\nvariable to include the \nScripts\n directory of your Python installation.\nRecent versions of Python include a script to do this for you. Navigate to\nyour Python installation directory (for example \nC:\\Python34\\\n), open the\n\nTools\n, then \nScripts\n folder, and run the \nwin_add2path.py\n file by double\nclicking on it. Alternatively, you can \ndownload\n the script and run it\n(\npython win_add2path.py\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Started\n\uf0c1\n\n\nGetting started is super easy.\n\n\nmkdocs new my-project\ncd my-project\n\n\n\n\nTake a moment to review the initial project that has been created for you.\n\n\n\n\nThere's a single configuration file named \nmkdocs.yml\n, and a folder named\n\ndocs\n that will contain your documentation source files. Right now the \ndocs\n\nfolder just contains a single documentation page, named \nindex.md\n.\n\n\nMkDocs comes with a built-in dev-server that lets you preview your documentation\nas you work on it. Make sure you're in the same directory as the \nmkdocs.yml\n\nconfiguration file, and then start the server by running the \nmkdocs serve\n\ncommand:\n\n\n$ mkdocs serve\nINFO    -  Building documentation...\nINFO    -  Cleaning site directory\n[I 160402 15:50:43 server:271] Serving on http://127.0.0.1:8000\n[I 160402 15:50:43 handlers:58] Start watching changes\n[I 160402 15:50:43 handlers:60] Start detecting changes\n\n\n\n\nOpen up \nhttp://127.0.0.1:8000/\n in your browser, and you'll see the default\nhome page being displayed:\n\n\n\n\nThe dev-server also supports auto-reloading, and will rebuild your documentation\nwhenever anything in the configuration file, documentation directory, or theme\ndirectory changes.\n\n\nOpen the \ndocs/index.md\n document in your text editor of choice, change the\ninitial heading to \nMkLorum\n, and save your changes. Your browser will\nauto-reload and you should see your updated documentation immediately.\n\n\nNow try editing the configuration file: \nmkdocs.yml\n. Change the\n\nsite_name\n setting to \nMkLorum\n and save the file.\n\n\nsite_name: MkLorum\n\n\n\n\nYour browser should immediately reload, and you'll see your new site name take\neffect.\n\n\n\n\nAdding pages\n\uf0c1\n\n\nNow add a second page to your documentation:\n\n\ncurl 'https://jaspervdj.be/lorem-markdownum/markdown.txt' \n docs/about.md\n\n\n\n\nAs our documentation site will include some navigation headers, you may want to\nedit the configuration file and add some information about the order, title, and\nnesting of each page in the navigation header by adding a \npages\n\nsetting:\n\n\nsite_name: MkLorum\npages:\n    - Home: index.md\n    - About: about.md\n\n\n\n\nSave your changes and you'll now see a navigation bar with \nHome\n and \nAbout\n\nitems on the left as well as \nSearch\n, \nPrevious\n, and \nNext\n items on the\nright.\n\n\n\n\nTry the menu items and navigate back and forth between pages. Then click on\n\nSearch\n. A search dialog will appear, allowing you to search for any text on\nany page. Notice that the search results include every occurrence of the search\nterm on the site and links directly to the section of the page in which the\nsearch term appears. You get of all that with no effort or configuration on your\npart!\n\n\n\n\nTheming our documentation\n\uf0c1\n\n\nNow change the configuration file to alter how the documentation is displayed by\nchanging the theme. Edit the \nmkdocs.yml\n file and add a \ntheme\n setting:\n\n\nsite_name: MkLorum\npages:\n    - Home: index.md\n    - About: about.md\ntheme: readthedocs\n\n\n\n\nSave your changes, and you'll see the ReadTheDocs theme being used.\n\n\n\n\nChanging the Favicon Icon\n\uf0c1\n\n\nBy default, MkDocs uses the \nMkDocs favicon\n icon. To use a different icon, create\nan \nimg\n subdirectory in your \ndocs_dir\n and copy your custom \nfavicon.ico\n file\nto that directory. MkDocs will automaticaly detect and use that file as your\nfavicon icon.\n\n\nBuilding the site\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThat's looking good. You're ready to deploy the first pass of your \nMkLorum\n\ndocumentation. First build the documentation:\n\n\nmkdocs build\n\n\n\n\nThis will create a new directory, named \nsite\n. Take a look inside the\ndirectory:\n\n\n$ ls site\nabout  fonts  index.html  license  search.html\ncss    img    js          mkdocs   sitemap.xml\n\n\n\n\nNotice that your source documentation has been output as two HTML files named\n\nindex.html\n and \nabout/index.html\n. You also have various other media that's\nbeen copied into the \nsite\n directory as part of the documentation theme. You\neven have a \nsitemap.xml\n file and \nmkdocs/search_index.json\n.\n\n\nIf you're using source code control such as \ngit\n you probably don't want to\ncheck your documentation builds into the repository. Add a line containing\n\nsite/\n to your \n.gitignore\n file.\n\n\necho \nsite/\n \n .gitignore\n\n\n\n\nIf you're using another source code control tool you'll want to check it's\ndocumentation on how to ignore specific directories.\n\n\nAfter some time, files may be removed from the documentation but they will still\nreside in the \nsite\n directory. To remove those stale files, just run \nmkdocs\n\nwith the \n--clean\n switch.\n\n\nmkdocs build --clean\n\n\n\n\nOther Commands and Options\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThere are various other commands and options available. For a complete list of\ncommands, use the \n--help\n flag:\n\n\nmkdocs --help\n\n\n\n\nTo view a list of options available on a given command, use the \n--help\n flag\nwith that command. For example, to get a list of all options available for the\n\nbuild\n command run the following:\n\n\nmkdocs build --help\n\n\n\n\nDeploying\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe documentation site that you just built only uses static files so you'll be\nable to host it from pretty much anywhere. \nGitHub project pages\n and \nAmazon\nS3\n may be good hosting options, depending upon your needs. Upload the contents\nof the entire \nsite\n directory to wherever you're hosting your website from and\nyou're done. For specific instructions on a number of common hosts, see the\n\nDeploying your Docs\n page.\n\n\nGetting help\n\uf0c1\n\n\nTo get help with MkDocs, please use the \ndiscussion group\n, \nGitHub issues\n or\nthe MkDocs IRC channel \n#mkdocs\n on freenode.",

If not provided, the pages configuration will be\nautomatically created by discovering all the Markdown files in the\n\ndocumentation directory\n. An\nautomatically created pages configuration will always be sorted\nalphanumerically by file name. You will need to manually define your pages\nconfiguration if you would like your pages sorted differently.\n\n\nA simple pages configuration looks like this:\n\n\npages:\n- 'index.md'\n- 'about.md'\n\n\n\n\nWith this example we will build two pages at the top level and they will\nautomatically have their titles inferred from the filename. Assuming \ndocs_dir\n\nhas the default value, \ndocs\n, the source files for this documentation would be\n\ndocs/index.md\n and \ndocs/about.md\n. To provide a custom name for these pages,\nthey can be added before the filename.\n\n\npages:\n- Home: 'index.md'\n- About: 'about.md'\n\n\n\n\nMultilevel documentation\n\uf0c1\n\n\nSubsections can be created by listing related pages together under a section\ntitle. For example:\n\n\npages:\n- Home: 'index.md'\n- User Guide:\n    - 'Writing your docs': 'user-guide/writing-your-docs.md'\n    - 'Styling your docs': 'user-guide/styling-your-docs.md'\n- About:\n    - 'License': 'about/license.md'\n    - 'Release Notes': 'about/release-notes.md'\n\n\n\n\nWith the above configuration we have three top level sections: Home, User Guide\nand About. Then under User Guide we have two pages, Writing your docs and\nStyling your docs. Under the About section we also have two pages, License and\nRelease Notes.\n\n\nFile layout\n\uf0c1\n\n\nYour documentation source should be written as regular Markdown files, and\nplaced in a directory somewhere in your project. Normally this directory will be\nnamed \ndocs\n and will exist at the top level of your project, alongside the\n\nmkdocs.yml\n configuration file.\n\n\nThe simplest project you can create will look something like this:\n\n\nmkdocs.yml\ndocs/\n    index.md\n\n\n\n\nBy convention your project homepage should always be named \nindex\n. Any of the\nfollowing extensions may be used for your Markdown source files: \nmarkdown\n,\n\nmdown\n, \nmkdn\n, \nmkd\n, \nmd\n.\n\n\nYou can also create multi-page documentation, by creating several markdown\nfiles:\n\n\nmkdocs.yml\ndocs/\n    index.md\n    about.md\n    license.md\n\n\n\n\nThe file layout you use determines the URLs that are used for the generated\npages. Given the above layout, pages would be generated for the following URLs:\n\n\n/\n/about/\n/license/\n\n\n\n\nYou can also include your Markdown files in nested directories if that better\nsuits your documentation layout.\n\n\ndocs/\n    index.md\n    user-guide/getting-started.md\n    user-guide/configuration-options.md\n    license.md\n\n\n\n\nSource files inside nested directories will cause pages to be generated with\nnested URLs, like so:\n\n\n/\n/user-guide/getting-started/\n/user-guide/configuration-options/\n/license/\n\n\n\n\nLinking documents\n\uf0c1\n\n\nMkDocs allows you to interlink your documentation by using regular Markdown\nhyperlinks.\n\n\nInternal hyperlinks\n\uf0c1\n\n\nWhen linking between pages in the documentation you can simply use the regular\nMarkdown hyperlinking syntax, including the relative path to the Markdown\ndocument you wish to link to.\n\n\nPlease see the [project license](license.md) for further details.\n\n\n\nWhen the MkDocs build runs, these hyperlinks will automatically be transformed\ninto a hyperlink to the appropriate HTML page.\n\n\nWhen working on your documentation you should be able to open the linked\nMarkdown document in a new editor window simply by clicking on the link.\n\n\nIf the target documentation file is in another directory you'll need to make\nsure to include any relative directory path in the hyperlink.\n\n\nPlease see the [project license](../about/license.md) for further details.\n\n\n\nYou can also link to a section within a target documentation page by using an\nanchor link. The generated HTML will correctly transform the path portion of the\nhyperlink, and leave the anchor portion intact.\n\n\nPlease see the [project license](about.md#license) for further details.\n\n\n\nImages and media\n\uf0c1\n\n\nAs well as the Markdown source files, you can also include other file types in\nyour documentation, which will be copied across when generating your\ndocumentation site. These might include images and other media.\n\n\nFor example, if your project documentation needed to include a \nGitHub pages\nCNAME\nfile\n\nand a PNG formatted screenshot image then your file layout might look as\nfollows:\n\n\nmkdocs.yml\ndocs/\n    CNAME\n    index.md\n    about.md\n    license.md\n    img/\n        screenshot.png\n\n\n\n\nTo include images in your documentation source files, simply use any of the\nregular Markdown image syntaxes:\n\n\nCupcake indexer is a snazzy new project for indexing small cakes.\n\n![Screenshot](img/screenshot.png)\n\n*Above: Cupcake indexer in progress*\n\n\n\n\nYou image will now be embedded when you build the documentation, and should also\nbe previewed if you're working on the documentation with a Markdown editor.\n\n\nMarkdown extensions\n\uf0c1\n\n\nMkDocs supports the following Markdown extensions.\n\n\nTables\n\uf0c1\n\n\nA simple table looks like this:\n\n\nFirst Header | Second Header | Third Header\n------------ | ------------- | ------------\nContent Cell | Content Cell  | Content Cell\nContent Cell | Content Cell  | Content Cell\n\n\n\n\nIf you wish, you can add a leading and tailing pipe to each line of the table:\n\n\n| First Header | Second Header | Third Header |\n| ------------ | ------------- | ------------ |\n| Content Cell | Content Cell  | Content Cell |\n| Content Cell | Content Cell  | Content Cell |\n\n\n\n\nSpecify alignment for each column by adding colons to separator lines:\n\n\nFirst Header | Second Header | Third Header\n:----------- |:-------------:| -----------:\nLeft         | Center        | Right\nLeft         | Center        | Right\n\n\n\n\nFenced code blocks\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe first line should contain 3 or more backtick (\n`\n) characters, and the\nlast line should contain the same number of backtick characters (\n`\n):\n\n\n```\nFenced code blocks are like Standard\nMarkdown\u2019s regular code blocks, except that\nthey\u2019re not indented and instead rely on\nstart and end fence lines to delimit the\ncode block.\n```\n\n\n\n\nWith this approach, the language can optionally be specified on the first line\nafter the backticks:\n\n\n```python\ndef fn():\n    pass\n```",

You\ncan also create your own \ncustom theme\n from the ground up for your\ndocumentation.\n\n\nTo use a theme that is included in MkDocs, simply add this to your\n\nmkdocs.yml\n config file.\n\n\ntheme: readthedocs\n\n\n\nReplace \nreadthedocs\n with any of the \nbuilt-in themes\n listed below.\n\n\nTo create a new custom theme see the \nCustom Themes\n page, or to\nmore heavily customize an existing theme, see\nthe \nCustomizing a Theme\n section below.\n\n\nBuilt-in themes\n\uf0c1\n\n\nmkdocs\n\uf0c1\n\n\n\n\nreadthedocs\n\uf0c1\n\n\n\n\nThird Party Themes\n\uf0c1\n\n\nA list of third party themes can be found in the MkDocs \ncommunity wiki\n. If you\nhave created your own, please feel free to add it to the list.\n\n\nCustomizing a Theme\n\uf0c1\n\n\nIf you would like to make a few tweaks to an existing theme, there is no need to\ncreate your own theme from scratch. For minor tweaks which only require some CSS\nand/or JavaScript, you can use the \ndocs_dir\n. However, for more complex\ncustomizations, including overriding templates, you will need to use the\n\ntheme_dir\n.\n\n\nUsing the docs_dir\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe \nextra_css\n and \nextra_javascript\n configuration options can be used to\nmake tweaks and customizations to existing themes. To use these, you simply\nneed to include either CSS or JavaScript files within your \ndocumentation\ndirectory\n.\n\n\nFor example, to change the colour of the headers in your documentation, create\na file called \nextra.css\n and place it next to the documentation Markdown. In\nthat file add the following CSS.\n\n\nh1 {\n  color: red;\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf you are deploying your documentation with \nReadTheDocs\n. You will need\nto explicitly list the CSS and JavaScript files you want to include in\nyour config. To do this, add the following to your mkdocs.yml.\n\n\nextra_css: [extra.css]\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter making these changes, they should be visible when you run\n\nmkdocs serve\n - if you already had this running, you should see that the CSS\nchanges were automatically picked up and the documentation will be updated.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nAny extra CSS or JavaScript files will be added to the generated HTML\ndocument after the page content. If you desire to include a JavaScript\nlibrary, you may have better success including the library by using the\n\ntheme_dir\n.\n\n\n\n\nUsing the theme_dir\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe \ntheme_dir\n configuration option can be used to point to a directory of\nfiles which override the files in the theme set on the \ntheme\n configuration\noption. Any file in the \ntheme_dir\n with the same name as a file in the \ntheme\n\nwill replace the file of the same name in the \ntheme\n. Any additional files in\nthe \ntheme_dir\n will be added to the \ntheme\n. The contents of the \ntheme_dir\n\nshould mirror the directory structure of the \ntheme\n. You may include templates,\nJavaScript files, CSS files, images, fonts, or any other media included in a\ntheme.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nFor this to work, the \ntheme\n setting must be set to a known installed theme.\nIf the \ntheme\n setting is instead set to \nnull\n (or not defined), then there\nis no theme to override and the contents of the \ntheme_dir\n must be a\ncomplete, standalone theme. See \nCustom Themes\n for more\ninformation.\n\n\n\n\nFor example, the \nmkdocs\n theme (\nbrowse source\n), contains the following\ndirectory structure (in part):\n\n\n- css\\\n- fonts\\\n- img\\\n  - favicon.ico\n  - grid.png\n- js\\\n- 404.html\n- base.html\n- content.html\n- nav-sub.html\n- nav.html\n- toc.html\n\n\n\n\nTo override any of the files contained in that theme, create a new directory\nnext to your \ndocs_dir\n:\n\n\nmkdir custom_theme\n\n\n\n\nAnd then point your \nmkdocs.yml\n configuration file at the new directory:\n\n\ntheme_dir: custom_theme\n\n\n\n\nTo override the 404 error page (\"file not found\"), add a new template file named\n\n404.html\n to the \ncustom_theme\n directory. For information on what can be\nincluded in a template, review the documentation for building a \ncustom theme\n.\n\n\nTo override the favicon, you can add a new icon file at\n\ncustom_theme/img/favicon.ico\n.\n\n\nTo include a JavaScript library, copy the library to the \ncustom_theme/js/\n\ndirectory.\n\n\nYour directory structure should now look like this:\n\n\n- docs/\n  - index.html\n- custom_theme/\n  - img/\n    - favicon.ico\n  - js/\n    - somelib.js\n  - 404.html\n- config.yml\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nAny files included in the \ntheme\n but not included in the \ntheme_dir\n will\nstill be utilized. The \ntheme_dir\n will only override/replace files in the\n\ntheme\n. If you want to remove files, or build a theme from scratch, then\nyou should review the documentation for building a \ncustom theme\n.\n\n\n\n\nOverriding Template Blocks\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe built-in themes implement many of their parts inside template blocks which\ncan be individually overridden in the \nmain.html\n template. Simply create a\n\nmain.html\n template file in your \ntheme_dir\n and define replacement blocks\nwithin that file. Just make sure that the \nmain.html\n extends \nbase.html\n. For\nexample, to alter the title of the MkDocs theme, your replacement \nmain.html\n\ntemplate would contain the following:\n\n\n{% extends \nbase.html\n %}\n\n{% block title %}\n\ntitle\nCustom title goes here\n/title\n\n{% endblock %}\n\n\n\n\nIn the above example, the title block defined in your custom \nmain.html\n file\nwill be used in place of the default title block defined in the parent theme.\nYou may re-define as many blocks as you desire, as long as those blocks are\ndefined in the parent. For example, you could replace the Google Analytics\nscript with one for a different service or replace the search feature with your\nown. You will need to consult the parent theme you are using to determine what\nblocks are available to override. The MkDocs and ReadTheDocs themes provide the\nfollowing blocks:\n\n\n\n\nsite_meta\n: Contains meta tags in the document head.\n\n\nhtmltitle\n: Contains the page title in the document head.\n\n\nstyles\n: Contains the link tags for stylesheets.\n\n\nlibs\n: Contains the JavaScript libraries (jQuery, etc) included in the page header.\n\n\nscripts\n: Contains JavaScript scripts which should execute after a page loads.\n\n\nanalytics\n: Contains the analytics script.\n\n\nextrahead\n: An empty block in the \nhead\n to insert custom tags/scripts/etc.\n\n\nsite_name\n: Contains the site name in the navigation bar.\n\n\nsite_nav\n: Contains the site navigation in the navigation bar.\n\n\nsearch_box\n: Contains the search box in the navigation bar.\n\n\nnext_prev\n: Contains the next and previous buttons in the navigation bar.\n\n\nrepo\n: Contains the repository link in the navigation bar.\n\n\ncontent\n: Contains the page content and table of contents for the page.\n\n\nfooter\n: Contains the page footer.\n\n\n\n\nYou may need to view the source template files to ensure your modifications will\nwork with the structure of the site. See \nTemplate Variables\n for a list of\nvariables you can use within your custom blocks. For a more complete\nexplaination of blocks, consult the \nJinja documentation\n.\n\n\nCombining the theme_dir and Template Blocks\n\uf0c1\n\n\nAdding a JavaScript library to the \ntheme_dir\n will make it available, but\nwon't include it in the pages generated by MkDocs. Therefore, a link needs to\nbe added to the library from the HTML.\n\n\nStarting the with directory structure above (truncated):\n\n\n- docs/\n- custom_theme/\n  - js/\n    - somelib.js\n- config.yml\n\n\n\n\nA link to the \ncustom_theme/js/somelib.js\n file needs to be added to the\ntemplate. As \nsomelib.js\n is a JavaScript library, it would logically go in the\n\nlibs\n block. However, a new \nlibs\n block that only includes the new script will\nreplace the block defined in the parent template and any links to libraries in\nthe parent template will be removed. To avoid breaking the template, a\n\nsuper block\n can be used with a call to \nsuper\n from within the block:\n\n\n{% extends \nbase.html\n %}\n\n{% block libs %}\n    {{ super() }}\n    \nscript src=\n{{ base_url }}/js/somelib.js\n/script\n\n{% endblock %}\n\n\n\n\nNote that the \nbase_url\n template variable was used to ensure that the link is\nalways relative to the current page.\n\n\nNow the generated pages will include links to the template provided libraries as\nwell as the library included in the \ntheme_dir\n. The same would be required for\nany additional CSS files included in the \ntheme_dir\n.",

For information on what can be\nincluded in a template, review the documentation for building a  custom theme .  To override the favicon, you can add a new icon file at custom_theme/img/favicon.ico .  To include a JavaScript library, copy the library to the  custom_theme/js/ \ndirectory.

Python Markdown supports a variety of \nextensions\n\nthat customize how pages are formatted. This setting lets you enable a list of\nextensions beyond the ones that MkDocs uses by default (\nmeta\n, \ntoc\n, \ntables\n,\nand \nfenced_code\n).\n\n\nFor example, to enable the \nSmartyPants typography extension\n, use:\n\n\nmarkdown_extensions:\n    - smarty\n\n\n\n\nSome extensions provide configuration options of their own. If you would like to\nset any configuration options, then you can nest a key/value mapping\n(\noption_name: option value\n) of any options that a given extension supports.\nSee the documentation for the extension you are using to determine what options\nthey support.\n\n\nFor example, to enable permalinks in the (included) \ntoc\n extension, use:\n\n\nmarkdown_extensions:\n    - toc:\n        permalink: True\n\n\n\n\nNote that a colon (\n:\n) must follow the extension name (\ntoc\n) and then on a new\nline the option name and value must be indented and separated by a colon. If you\nwould like to define multiple options for a single extension, each option must be\ndefined on a separate line:\n\n\nmarkdown_extensions:\n    - toc:\n        permalink: True\n        separator: \n_\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd an additional item to the list for each extension. If you have no\nconfiguration options to set for a specific extension, then simply omit options\nfor that extension:\n\n\nmarkdown_extensions:\n    - smarty\n    - toc:\n        permalink: True\n    - sane_lists\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee Also:\n\n\nThe Python-Markdown documentation provides a \nlist of extensions\n\nwhich are available out-of-the-box. For a list of configuration options\navailable for a given extension, see the documentation for that extension.\n\n\nYou may also install and use various \nthird party extensions\n.

If\nyou want to share a theme you create, you should list it on the Wiki.\n\n\n\n\nWhen creating a new theme, you can either follow the steps in this guide to\ncreate one from scratch or you can download the \nmkdocs-basic-theme\n as a\nbasic, yet complete, theme with all the boilerplate required. \nYou can find\nthis base theme on \nGitHub\n.\nIt contains detailed comments in the code to describe the different features\nand their usage.\n\n\nCreating a custom theme\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe bare minimum required for a custom theme is a \nmain.html\n \nJinja2\ntemplate\n file. This should be placed in a directory which will be the\n\ntheme_dir\n and it should be created next to the \nmkdocs.yml\n configuration\nfile. Within \nmkdocs.yml\n, specify the \ntheme_dir\n option and set it to the\nname of the directory containing \nmain.html\n. For example, given this example\nproject layout:\n\n\nmkdocs.yml\ndocs/\n    index.md\n    about.md\ncustom_theme/\n    main.html\n    ...\n\n\n\nYou would include the following settings in \nmkdocs.yml\n to use the custom theme\ndirectory:\n\n\ntheme: null\ntheme_dir: 'custom_theme'\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nGenerally, when building your own custom theme, the \ntheme\n configuration\nsetting would be set to \nnull\n. However, if used in combination with the\n\ntheme_dir\n configuration value a custom theme can be used to replace only\nspecific parts of a built-in theme. For example, with the above layout and\nif you set \ntheme: \"mkdocs\"\n then the \nmain.html\n file in the \ntheme_dir\n\nwould replace that in the theme but otherwise the \nmkdocs\n theme would\nremain the same. This is useful if you want to make small adjustments to an\nexisting theme.\n\n\nFor more specific information, see \nstyling your docs\n.\n\n\n\n\nBasic theme\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe simplest \nmain.html\n file is the following:\n\n\n!DOCTYPE html\n\n\nhtml\n\n  \nhead\n\n    \ntitle\n{% if page_title %}{{ page_title }} - {% endif %}{{ site_name }}\n/title\n\n  \n/head\n\n  \nbody\n\n    {{ content }}\n  \n/body\n\n\n/html\n\n\n\n\n\nArticle content from each page specified in \nmkdocs.yml\n is inserted using the\n\n{{ content }}\n tag. Style-sheets and scripts can be brought into this theme as\nwith a normal HTML file. Navbars and tables of contents can also be generated\nand included automatically, through the \nnav\n and \ntoc\n objects, respectively.\nIf you wish to write your own theme, it is recommended to start with one of\nthe \nbuilt-in themes\n and modify it accordingly.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nAs MkDocs uses \nJinja\n as its template engine, you have access to all the\npower of Jinja, including \ntemplate inheritance\n. You may notice that the\nthemes included with MkDocs make extensive use of template inheritance and\nblocks, allowing users to easily override small bits and pieces of the\ntemplates from the \ntheme_dir\n. Therefore, the built-in themes are\nimplemented in a \nbase.html\n file, which \nmain.html\n extends. Although not\nrequired, third party template authors are encouraged to follow a similar\npattern and may want to define the same \nblocks\n as are used in the built-in\nthemes for consistency.\n\n\n\n\nTemplate Variables\n\uf0c1\n\n\nEach template in a theme is built with a template context. These are the\nvariables that are available to themes. The context varies depending on the\ntemplate that is being built. At the moment templates are either built with\nthe global context or with a page specific context. The global context is used\nfor HTML pages that don't represent an individual Markdown document, for\nexample a 404.html page or search.html.\n\n\nGlobal Context\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe following variables are available globally on any template.\n\n\nconfig\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe \nconfig\n variable is an instance of MkDocs' config object generated from the\n\nmkdocs.yml\n config file. While you can use any config option, some commonly\nused options include:\n\n\n\n\nconfig.site_name\n\n\nconfig.site_url\n\n\nconfig.site_author\n\n\nconfig.site_description\n\n\nconfig.repo_url\n\n\nconfig.repo_name\n\n\nconfig.copyright\n\n\nconfig.google_analytics\n\n\n\n\nnav\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe \nnav\n variable is used to create the navigation for the documentation.\nFollowing is a basic usage example which outputs the first and second level\nnavigation as a nested list.\n\n\n{% if nav|length\n1 %}\n    \nul\n\n    {% for nav_item in nav %}\n        {% if nav_item.children %}\n            \nli\n{{ nav_item.title }}\n                \nul\n\n                {% for nav_item in nav_item.children %}\n                    \nli class=\n{% if nav_item.active%}current{%endif%}\n\n                        \na href=\n{{ nav_item.url }}\n{{ nav_item.title }}\n/a\n\n                    \n/li\n\n                {% endfor %}\n                \n/ul\n\n            \n/li\n\n        {% else %}\n            \nli class=\n{% if nav_item.active%}current{%endif%}\n\n                \na href=\n{{ nav_item.url }}\n{{ nav_item.title }}\n/a\n\n            \n/li\n\n        {% endif %}\n    {% endfor %}\n    \n/ul\n\n{% endif %}\n\n\n\n\nThe \nnav\n object also contains a \nhomepage\n object, which points to the \npage\n\nobject of the homepage. For example, you may want to access \nnav.homepage.url\n.\n\n\nbase_url\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe \nbase_url\n provides a relative path to the root of the MkDocs project.\nThis makes it easy to include links to static assets in your theme. For\nexample, if your theme includes a \njs\n folder, to include \ntheme.js\n from that\nfolder on all pages you would do this:\n\n\nscript src=\n{{ base_url }}/js/theme.js\n/script\n\n\n\n\n\nextra_css\n\uf0c1\n\n\nContains a list of URLs to the style-sheets listed in the \nextra_css\n\nconfig setting. Unlike the config setting, which contains local paths, this\nvariable contains absolute paths from the homepage.\n\n\nextra_javascript\n\uf0c1\n\n\nContains a list of URLs to the scripts listed in the \nextra_javascript\n config\nsetting. Unlike the config setting, which contains local paths, this variable\ncontains absolute paths from the homepage.\n\n\nmkdocs_version\n\uf0c1\n\n\nContains the current MkDocs version.\n\n\nbuild_date_utc\n\uf0c1\n\n\nA Python datetime object that represents the date and time the documentation\nwas built in UTC. This is useful for showing how recently the documentation\nwas updated.\n\n\npage\n\uf0c1\n\n\nIn templates which are not rendered from a Markdown source file, the \npage\n\nvariable is \nNone\n. In templates which are rendered from a Markdown source file,\nthe \npage\n variable contains a page object with the following attributes:\n\n\npage.title\n\uf0c1\n\n\nContains the Title for the current page.\n\n\npage.content\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe rendered Markdown as HTML, this is the contents of the documentation.\n\n\npage.toc\n\uf0c1\n\n\nAn object representing the Table of contents for a page. Displaying the table\nof contents as a simple list can be achieved like this.\n\n\nul\n\n{% for toc_item in page.toc %}\n    \nli\na href=\n{{ toc_item.url }}\n{{ toc_item.title }}\n/a\n/li\n\n    {% for toc_item in toc_item.children %}\n        \nli\na href=\n{{ toc_item.url }}\n{{ toc_item.title }}\n/a\n/li\n\n    {% endfor %}\n{% endfor %}\n\n/ul\n\n\n\n\n\npage.meta\n\uf0c1\n\n\nA mapping of the metadata included at the top of the markdown page. In this\nexample we define a \nsource\n property above the page title.\n\n\nsource: generics.py\n        mixins.py\n\n# Page title\n\nContent...\n\n\n\n\nA template can access this metadata for the page with the \nmeta.source\n\nvariable. This could then be used to link to source files related to the\ndocumentation page.\n\n\n{% for filename in page.meta.source %}\n  \na class=\ngithub\n href=\nhttps://github.com/.../{{ filename }}\n\n    \nspan class=\nlabel label-info\n{{ filename }}\n/span\n\n  \n/a\n\n{% endfor %}\n\n\n\n\npage.canonical_url\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe full, canonical URL to the current page. This includes the \nsite_url\n from\nthe configuration.\n\n\npage.edit_url\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe full URL to the input page in the source repository. Typically used to\nprovide a link to edit the source page.\n\n\npage.url\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe URL to the current page not including the \nsite_url\n from the configuration.\n\n\npage.is_homepage\n\uf0c1\n\n\nEvaluates to \nTrue\n for the homepage of the site and \nFalse\n for all other\npages. This can be used in conjunction with other attributes of the \npage\n\nobject to alter the behavior. For example, to display a different title\non the homepage:\n\n\n{% if not page.is_homepage %}{{ page.title }} - {% endif %}{{ site_name }}\n\n\n\n\npage.previous_page\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe page object for the previous  page. The usage is the same as for\n\npage\n.\n\n\npage.next_page\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe page object for the next page.The usage is the same as for \npage\n.\n\n\nExtra Context\n\uf0c1\n\n\nAdditional variables can be passed to the template with the\n\nextra\n configuration option. This is a\nset of key value pairs that can make custom templates far more flexible.\n\n\nFor example, this could be used to include the project version of all pages\nand a list of links related to the project. This can be achieved with the\nfollowing \nextra\n configuration:\n\n\nextra:\n    version: 0.13.0\n    links:\n        - https://github.com/mkdocs\n        - https://docs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/builds.html#mkdocs\n        - http://www.mkdocs.org/\n\n\n\n\nAnd then displayed with this HTML in the custom theme.\n\n\n{{ config.extra.version }}\n\n{% if config.extra.links %}\n  \nul\n\n  {% for link in config.extra.links %}\n      \nli\n{{ link }}\n/li\n\n  {% endfor %}\n  \n/ul\n\n{% endif %}\n\n\n\n\nSearch and themes\n\uf0c1\n\n\nAs of MkDocs \n0.13\n client side search support has been added to MkDocs with\n\nLunr.js\n.\n\n\nSearch can either be added to every page in the theme or to a dedicated\ntemplate which must be named \nsearch.html\n. The search template will be built\nwith the same name and can be viewable with \nmkdocs serve\n at\n\nhttp://localhost:8000/search.html\n. An example of the two different\napproaches can be seen by comparing the \nmkdocs\n and \nreadthedocs\n themes.\n\n\nThe following HTML needs to be added to the theme so the JavaScript is loaded\nfor Lunr.js.\n\n\nscript\nvar base_url = '{{ base_url }}';\n/script\n\n\nscript data-main=\n{{ base_url }}/mkdocs/js/search.js\n src=\n{{ base_url }}/mkdocs/js/require.js\n/script\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThe above JavaScript will download the search index, for larger\ndocumentation projects this can be a heavy operation. In those cases, it\nis suggested that you either use the \nsearch.html\n approach to only\ninclude search on one page or load the JavaScript on an event like a form\nsubmit.\n\n\n\n\nThis loads the JavaScript and sets a global variable \nbase_url\n which allows\nthe JavaScript to make the links relative to the current page. The above\nJavaScript, with the following HTML in a \nsearch.html\n template will add a\nfull search implementation to your theme.\n\n\nh1 id=\nsearch\nSearch Results\n/h1\n\n\n\nform action=\nsearch.html\n\n  \ninput name=\nq\n id=\nmkdocs-search-query\n type=\ntext\n \n\n\n/form\n\n\n\ndiv id=\nmkdocs-search-results\n\n  Sorry, page not found.\n\n/div\n\n\n\n\n\nThis works by looking for the specific ID's used in the above HTML. The input\nfor the user to type the search query must have the ID \nmkdocs-search-query\n\nand \nmkdocs-search-results\n is the directory where the results will be placed.\n\n\nPackaging Themes\n\uf0c1\n\n\nMkDocs makes use of \nPython packaging\n to distribute themes. This comes with a\nfew requirements.\n\n\nTo see an example of a package containing one theme, see the \nMkDocs Bootstrap\ntheme\n and to see a package that contains many themes, see the \nMkDocs\nBootswatch theme\n.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIt is not strictly necessary to package a theme, as the entire theme\ncan be contained in the \ntheme_dir\n. If you have created a \"one-off theme,\"\nthat should be sufficent. However, if you intend to distribute your theme\nfor others to use, packaging the theme has some advantages. By packaging\nyour theme, your users can more easily install it and they can them take\nadvantage of the \ntheme_dir\n to make tweaks to your theme to better suit\ntheir needs.\n\n\n\n\nPackage Layout\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe following layout is recommended for themes. Two files at the top level\ndirectory called \nMANIFEST.in\n amd \nsetup.py\n beside the theme directory which\ncontains an empty \n__init__.py\n file and your template and media files.\n\n\n.\n|-- MANIFEST.in\n|-- theme_name\n|   |-- __init__.py\n|   |-- main.html\n|   |-- styles.css\n`-- setup.py\n\n\n\n\nThe \nMANIFEST.in\n file should contain the following contents but with\ntheme_name updated and any extra file extensions added to the include.\n\n\nrecursive-include theme_name *.ico *.js *.css *.png *.html *.eot *.svg *.ttf *.woff\nrecursive-exclude * __pycache__\nrecursive-exclude * *.py[co]\n\n\n\n\nThe \nsetup.py\n should include the following text with the modifications\ndescribed below.\n\n\nfrom setuptools import setup, find_packages\n\nVERSION = '0.0.1'\n\n\nsetup(\n    name=\nmkdocs-themename\n,\n    version=VERSION,\n    url='',\n    license='',\n    description='',\n    author='',\n    author_email='',\n    packages=find_packages(),\n    include_package_data=True,\n    entry_points={\n        'mkdocs.themes': [\n            'themename = theme_name',\n        ]\n    },\n    zip_safe=False\n)\n\n\n\n\nFill in the URL, license, description, author and author email address.\n\n\nThe name should follow the convention \nmkdocs-themename\n (like \nmkdocs-\nbootstrap\n and \nmkdocs-bootswatch\n), starting with MkDocs, using hyphens to\nseparate words and including the name of your theme.\n\n\nMost of the rest of the file can be left unedited. The last section we need to\nchange is the entry_points. This is how MkDocs finds the theme(s) you are\nincluding in the package. The name on the left is the one that users will use\nin their mkdocs.yml and the one on the right is the directory containing your\ntheme files.\n\n\nThe directory you created at the start of this section with the main.html file\nshould contain all of the other theme files. The minimum requirement is that\nit includes a \nmain.html\n for the theme. It \nmust\n also include a\n\n__init__.py\n file which should be empty, this file tells Python that the\ndirectory is a package.\n\n\nDistributing Themes\n\uf0c1\n\n\nWith the above changes, your theme should now be ready to install. This can be\ndone with pip, using \npip install .\n if you are still in the same directory as\nthe setup.py.\n\n\nMost Python packages, including MkDocs, are distributed on PyPI. To do this,\nyou should run the following command.\n\n\npython setup.py register\n\n\n\n\nIf you don't have an account setup, you should be prompted to create one.\n\n\nFor a much more detailed guide, see the official Python packaging\ndocumentation for \nPackaging and Distributing Projects\n.",

The variable will issue a warning but continue to work for\nversion 0.16, but may be removed in a future version. Use \nnav.homepage.url\n\ninstead.\n\n\nThe global variable \nfavicon\n maps to the configuration setting \nsite_favicon\n.\nBoth the template variable and the configuration setting are being deprecated\nand will issue a warning but continue to work for version 0.16, and may be\nremoved in a future version.

(#607)\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe built-in themes have been updated by having each of their many parts wrapped\nin template blocks which allow each individual block to be easily overridden\nusing the \ntheme_dir\n config setting. Without any new settings, you can use a\ndifferent analytics service, replace the default search function, or alter the\nbehavior of the navigation, among other things. See the relevant\n\ndocumentation\n for more details.\n\n\nTo enable this feature, the primary entry point for page templates has been\nchanged from \nbase.html\n to \nmain.html\n. This allows \nbase.html\n to continue to\nexist while allowing users to override \nmain.html\n and extend \nbase.html\n. For\nversion 0.16, \nbase.html\n will continue to work if no \nmain.html\n template\nexists, but it is deprecated and will raise a warning. In version 1.0, a build\nwill fail if no \nmain.html\n template exists. Any custom and third party\ntemplates should be updated accordingly.\n\n\nThe easiest way for a third party theme to be updated would be to simply add a\n\nmain.html\n file which only contains the following line:\n\n\n{% extends \nbase.html\n %}\n\n\n\n\nThat way, the theme contains the \nmain.html\n entry point, and also supports\noverriding blocks in the same manner as the built-in themes. Third party themes\nare encouraged to wrap the various pieces of their templates in blocks in order\nto support such customization.\n\n\nAuto-Populated \nextra_css\n and \nextra_javascript\n Deprecated. (#986)\n\uf0c1\n\n\nIn previous versions of MkDocs, if the \nextra_css\n or \nextra_javascript\n config\nsettings were empty, MkDocs would scan the \ndocs_dir\n and auto-populate each\nsetting with all of the CSS and JavaScript files found. This behavior is\ndeprecated and a warning will be issued. In the next release, the auto-populate\nfeature will stop working and any unlisted CSS and JavaScript files will not be\nincluded in the HTML templates. In other words, they will still be copied to the\n\nsite-dir\n, but they will not have any effect on the theme if they are not\nexplicitly listed.\n\n\nAll CSS and javaScript files in the \ndocs_dir\n should be explicitly listed in\nthe \nextra_css\n or \nextra_javascript\n config settings going forward.\n\n\nSupport for dirty builds. (#990)\n\uf0c1\n\n\nFor large sites the build time required to create the pages can become problematic,\nthus a \"dirty\" build mode was created. This mode simply compares the modified time\nof the generated HTML and source markdown. If the markdown has changed since the\nHTML then the page is re-constructed. Otherwise, the page remains as is. This mode\nmay be invoked in both the \nmkdocs serve\n and \nmkdocs build\n commands:\n\n\nmkdocs serve --dirtyreload\n\n\n\n\nmkdocs build --dirty\n\n\n\n\nIt is important to note that this method for building the pages is for development\nof content only, since the navigation and other links do not get updated on other\npages.\n\n\nStricter Directory Validation\n\uf0c1\n\n\nPreviously, a warning was issued if the \nsite_dir\n was a child directory of the\n\ndocs_dir\n. This now raises an error. Additionally, an error is now raised if\nthe \ndocs_dir\n is set to the directory which contains your config file rather\nthan a child directory. You will need to rearrange you directory structure to\nbetter conform with the documented \nlayout\n.\n\n\nOther Changes and Additions to Version 0.16.0\n\uf0c1\n\n\n\n\nBugfix: Support \ngh-deploy\n command on Windows with Python 3 (#722)\n\n\nBugfix: Include .woff2 font files in Python package build (#894)\n\n\nVarious updates and improvements to Documentation Home Page/Tutorial (#870)\n\n\nBugfix: Support livereload for config file changes (#735)\n\n\nBugfix: Non-media template files are no longer copied with media files (#807)\n\n\nAdd a flag (-e/--theme-dir) to specify theme directory with the commands\n  \nmkdocs build\n and \nmkdocs serve\n (#832)\n\n\nFixed issues with Unicode file names under Windows and Python 2.

This will enable them to be more easily\nsupported and updates outside MkDocs releases.\n\n\nMajor Additions to Version 0.13.0\n\uf0c1\n\n\nSearch\n\uf0c1\n\n\nSupport for search has now been added to MkDocs. This is based on the\nJavaScript library \nlunr.js\n. It has been added to both the \nmkdocs\n and\n\nreadthedocs\n themes. See the custom theme documentation on \nsupporting search\n\nfor adding it to your own themes.\n\n\nNew Command Line Interface\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe command line interface for MkDocs has been re-written with the Python\nlibrary \nClick\n. This means that MkDocs now has an easier to use interface\nwith better help output.\n\n\nThis change is partially backwards incompatible as while undocumented it was\npossible to pass any configuration option to the different commands. Now only\na small subset of the configuration options can be passed to the commands. To\nsee in full commands and available arguments use \nmkdocs --help\n and\n\nmkdocs build --help\n to have them displayed.\n\n\nSupport Extra HTML and XML files\n\uf0c1\n\n\nLike the \nextra_javascript\n and \nextra_css\n configuration options, a new\noption named \nextra_templates\n has been added. This will automatically be\npopulated with any \n.html\n or \n.xml\n files in the project docs directory.\n\n\nUsers can place static HTML and XML files and they will be copied over, or they\ncan also use Jinja2 syntax and take advantage of the \nglobal variables\n.\n\n\nBy default MkDocs will use this approach to create a sitemap for the\ndocumentation.\n\n\nOther Changes and Additions to Version 0.13.0\n\uf0c1\n\n\n\n\nAdd support for \nMarkdown extension configuration options\n.
